1) I have used fingerprint2.js to expedite the development we can use our own code but would require some development and testing time

2) The fingerprint used in the assignment is browser specific, we can exclude the browser component from the fingerprint, as I am not aware of  business rules

3) I did some quick research and found that canvas based fingerprinting is more robust but does not seem like a trivial task and might take some effort and research

4) Added some dummy api end point so will get an error

5) initially started this with module based pattern, refactored the same to the class based syntax
